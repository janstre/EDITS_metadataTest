title: MISO2 input data example
description: |-
  This is an example of exogenous data input for the MISO2 model.
  MISO2 is under development. 

  A previous model version can be found under DOI 
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.09.010.

dimension:
  time:
    scope: 1900-2019
    resolution: annual
    description: yearly steps from 1900 to 2019 assumed to go from January 1st to December 31st
  space:
    scope: global
    resolution: 187 countries: Albania (ISOCode1), Armenia(ISOCode2), ..
    description: >-
      Countries as defined by ISO3116 codes. Codes in brackets above.
  material quality:
    scope: 14 materials
    resolution: cement, bitumen, bricks, sand and gravel, iron and steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, other metals, solidwood, paper, plastics
    description: >-
      Materials are understood as engineering materials.
  end-use:
    scope: the number of end-uses that can be distinguished is evaluated at the moment
    resolution: tbd
    description: >-
      End-uses are the products or product groups demanded by society such as cars or transport infrastructure.


measure:
  material production:
    description: >-
      Material mass produced in a certain country and year.
  end-use split:
    description: >-
      A ratio/transfer coefficient that determines which share of material production ends up in a certain end-use.
  average lifetime:
    description: >-
      The average lifetime of a certain end-use (product group) depicting the average time which a material stays in use.
      Can be used in different probability distributions to model the probability of material flowing out of use.
  


quantity:
- measure: material production
  dimensions: [time, space, material quality]
  units: kilogram
  description: >-
    Data on material production needs to be adjusted for trade in order to reach
    apparent consumption of materials.

- measure: end-use split
  dimensions: [time, space, material quality]
  units: percentage
  description: >-
    End-use splits were derived via a combination of industry shipment data and
    input-output tables as described in Paper X, DOI 123.

- measure: average lifetime
  dimensions: [time, space, material quality, end-use]
  units: year
  description: >-
    The average lifetime might need to be transformed to other parameters in order to
    fit probability distributions other than the normal distribution.
